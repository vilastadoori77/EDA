Then you will learn a methodical way to conduct EDA by breaking the process down into 5 steps - data sourcing, data cleaning, analysing variables individually, understanding the relationships between variables, and creating new variables. 

The structure for analytics problem solving is called the CRISP-DM framework - Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. 

Business Understanding
	1) Business Objective --> Expects ROI Is it 5%, 10% or 20%
		i) Goals for Data Analysis
		-> Analysis of current investment across
			i) Sectors(mobile/tech etc)
			ii) Cluster of sectors
			
	2) Understanding The data
		i)Collect Relevant Data
			i) Structured Data
				
		ii) Describe Data Sets(crunched based data)
				i)Create Data Dictonary, Summarize the data
		iii) Explore Data
				i) Create Graphs in MS Excel or R to understand range of funding 
		iv) Verify data quality( Check Data Quality)
				i) Is the data complete , Types of Errors, Is the data correct , Are there any missing values , How common are the missing values.?
		
	3) Preparing Data For Analysis
		i) Select Relevant Data
		ii) Integrate Data
		iii) Clean discrepencies
		iv) Construct the data
		v) Organizing the data which does not change its meaning
		
		
		
Heart of Data Analysis and Modelling

Modelling is the heart of the data analytics.
	1) Set of numbers 4,9,16,25
	2) Models are always succcint( Clearly Expressed)
	3) Mathematically Sound
	4) Efficient and Easy to Use.
	
	How to model using the algorithms:
		1) K-Means clustering algorithm
		2) Partitional clustering algorithm
		3) Hiearchial clustering algorithm
		4) Association rule mining
		
		
Modelling --> Family of Models --> Algorithm chosen from the family of models.
